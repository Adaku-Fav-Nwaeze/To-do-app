# Flask To-do App

A very simple to-do list app built with Flask. I made this to learn about form handling and basic CRUD operations without using a database.

### Features
- View all tasks
- Add a new task using a form
- Delete a task by clicking a delete link
- All tasks are stored in a Python list/dict (memory only)

### Tools used
- Python (Flask)
- HTML forms
- Basic CSS

### How to run
1. Clone the repo  
   `git clone https://github.com/Adaku-Fav-Nwaeze/To-do-app.git`
2. Install Flask  
   `pip install flask`
3. Run the app  
   `python app4.py`
4. Open in browser  
   `http://127.0.0.1:5000/todos`

This was my first attempt at handling form submissions with Flask. It gave me a clear idea of how `request.form` works.
